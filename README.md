## Description 📖

The Team Profile Generator Your is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person, including their name, role, employee ID number, and email.

## Features 📝

The app uses inquirer to prompt the user in the terminal to input information.

Object-oriented programming takes the user inputed information from the command line and generates objects in JS indexes. 

Then that information is written to an html index using the file system module.

Testing is key to making code maintainable, so also featuerd are a unit tests for every part of my code.
